description: >
  3D printing is a process in which material is joined or solidified under computer control 
  to create an object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder 
  grains being fused together). Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically 
  are produced using digital model data from a 3D model file created by artist.
