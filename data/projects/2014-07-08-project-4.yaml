  This visualization of a Mandelbrot set was created by Me :) using an example 
  [code snippet](//github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/blob/master/ch3/mandelbrot/main.go) 
  (with minor changes) introduced in the book called "The Go Programming Language" 
  by A. A. Donovan and B. W. Kernighan.  
  <br>Julia set consists of values such that an arbitrarily small perturbation can cause drastic 
  changes in the sequence of iterated function values. Thus the behavior of the function on 
  the Julia set its behavior is 'chaotic'.
  <br>Even thought Gaston Julia described the iteration of a rational function in 1925, 
  "true" graphs of such functions were plotted by Benoit Mandelbrot using a computer in 1970s.
  A legendary Mandelbrot set visualization is actually a special case of the Julia set.
