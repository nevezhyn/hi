  The images were created by feeding a picture into the neural network, and asking emphasise feature 
   it recognised - in this case, animals. Google team trains an artificial neural network by showing 
   it millions of training examples and gradually adjusting the network parameters until it gives the 
   classifications the team want.
   <br>The researchers also asked the system to analyse Edvard Munch's The Scream - which was turned
   into a portrait of a dog.
   <br>The team has even given the images a name - <strong>Inceptionism<strong>.
